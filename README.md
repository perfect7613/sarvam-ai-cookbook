#### Getting Started

To use the examples in this cookbook, you'll need a **Sarvam API key**. If you donâ€™t have one yet, sign up for a free account [here](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai/). Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable:

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```plaintext

```

Most examples are written in **Python**, but the concepts can be adapted to any programming language.
